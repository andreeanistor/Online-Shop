It is a console application for an online clothing store. The data is stocked in a database wrote in MySQL. 
Only admins have access to personal data of users like password or to confidential information like number of orders, products out of the stock etc. 
Admins also can add/delete/update product.
An user can add products in his cart (if the product is out of the stock the application will write a message and show the menu again) and pay for them. 
Each order is stocked on the database and only admins can access all orders. Each user can access his order.
